height = float(input("Enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))

BMI = round(weight/(height**2),2)
if (BMI<18.5):
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are underweight")
elif (BMI<25):
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are normal")
elif (BMI<30):
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are overweight")
else:
    print(f"Your BMI is {BMI}, you are obese")
