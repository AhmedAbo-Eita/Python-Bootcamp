# We need to paint a wall. we do not know how many cans of paint we need to buy.
# The instructions on the paint can say that 1 can of paint can cover 4 square meters of wall.
# So we need to define a function which takes as parameter  height and width of wall and
# calculates the area of the wall and based on the area we can calculate number of cans of paint that we need.

# Area of wall = wall height  *  wall width
# Number of cans of paint that is needed =  Area of wall รท coverage per can.
# Example
# Height = 2, Width = 5, Coverage = 4
# Area of wall = 2  *  5  = 10
# Number of cans of paint that is needed =  10 รท 4 = 2.5
# But because you can't buy 2.5 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 3 cans.
# Hint: To round up number ceil function from math module can be used. Math.ceil()
